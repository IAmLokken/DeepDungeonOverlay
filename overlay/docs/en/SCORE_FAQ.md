### Do the buff pets in Heaven-on-High affect score?
>No. However, it is believed that they take a spawn point that would have otherwise been a monster. 

### Does using pomanders affect score?
>No.  Only looting pomanders via opening chests affects score.

### Do Banded Coffers (intuition chests) affect score?
>No.  

### Do exploding chests affect score?
>No.  Exploding chests are currently believed to be score neutral (i.e. they do not count as chests or traps).

### Are luring traps good for score?
>Yes.  Killing the three monsters spawned from a luring trap is worth more points than those lost by triggering the trap.

### Do boss adds affect score?
>No.
